    title: "Getting Started with React",
    content: "React is a powerful JavaScript library for building dynamic user interfaces. Developed by Facebook, it allows developers to create reusable UI components that update efficiently when data changes. React uses a virtual DOM to optimize rendering performance, making it faster than traditional DOM manipulation. To start, you'll need Node.js installed to use create-react-app. JSX syntax might look unfamiliar at first, but it combines HTML with JavaScript logic seamlessly. State management is crucial—use useState for local state and Context API or Redux for global state. React Hooks revolutionized functional components by enabling state and lifecycle features. Always structure your components logically and keep them small for maintainability. Testing with Jest and React Testing Library ensures reliability. Deploying a React app is straightforward with platforms like Vercel or Netlify.",

    title: "CSS Grid Layout Tutorial",
    content: "CSS Grid is a revolutionary layout system for modern web design. Unlike Flexbox (1D), Grid handles rows and columns simultaneously (2D). Start by defining a container with display: grid. Use grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows to structure your layout. The fr unit distributes space proportionally. Grid gaps add spacing between items without margins. Named grid areas with grid-template-areas improve readability. Media queries make grids responsive. Use minmax() for flexible column widths. Auto-placement saves time for simple layouts. Grid works perfectly with Flexbox—use Grid for overall layout and Flexbox for component alignment. Browser support is excellent, but always test on older versions. Tools like Firefox Grid Inspector help visualize layouts during development.",

    title: "MongoDB Aggregation Framework",
    content: "MongoDB's aggregation pipeline is a powerful tool for data transformation. It processes documents through stages like $match, $group, and $sort. The $match stage filters documents early for better performance. Use $project to reshape documents and include/exclude fields. $group is essential for summaries and statistics. $unwind breaks arrays into multiple documents for processing. $lookup performs left outer joins between collections. Accumulators like $sum and $avg calculate values in $group stages. Pipeline optimization is crucial—place $match early to reduce documents processed. Indexes dramatically speed up aggregations. Use $facet for multi-faceted aggregations in a single query. Always test with explain() to analyze performance. For complex logic, consider mixing aggregations with application code.",

    title: "Responsive Web Design Principles",
    content: "Responsive design ensures websites work flawlessly across all devices. Mobile-first approach means designing for small screens first. Fluid grids use percentages rather than fixed pixels. Flexible images scale with max-width: 100%. Media queries apply CSS conditionally based on screen size. Breakpoints should be content-based, not device-specific. Viewport meta tag controls mobile rendering. Relative units (em, rem) scale better than pixels. CSS Grid and Flexbox simplify responsive layouts. Images should use srcset for performance. Touch targets need adequate size (minimum 48x48px). Navigation transforms between desktop and mobile. Performance is critical—optimize assets and lazy-load content. Test on real devices, not just emulators. Progressive enhancement ensures core functionality works everywhere.",

    title: "TypeScript for Beginners",
    content: "TypeScript adds static typing to JavaScript, catching errors during development. Interfaces define object shapes for better documentation. Types can be primitive (string, number) or complex (unions, generics). Type inference often eliminates manual type annotations. Enums provide named constants. Classes support access modifiers (public, private). Decorators add metadata to classes/methods. Modules organize code with import/export. Compilation strips types to produce clean JavaScript. Configuration via tsconfig.json controls strictness. Integration with IDEs enables autocompletion and refactoring. Declaration files (.d.ts) describe existing JavaScript libraries. Gradually migrating JavaScript projects is possible with allowJs. TypeScript works seamlessly with React (use .tsx files). The learning curve pays off in maintainability for large projects.",

    title: "Python vs JavaScript: Key Differences",
    content: "When choosing between Python and JavaScript, it's important to understand their core differences. Python excels in data science, AI, and backend development with frameworks like Django. JavaScript dominates web development through browsers and Node.js. Python uses indentation for code blocks while JavaScript uses curly braces. JavaScript runs on the event loop model while Python is synchronous by default. Type coercion works differently - JavaScript is more aggressive ('5' + 3 = '53'). Python has richer standard libraries for math/science. JavaScript handles asynchronous operations better with Promises. Python's package management (pip) is more mature than npm. Both languages support OOP but Python implements it more cleanly. For beginners, Python has gentler learning curve. JavaScript's versatility makes it essential for full-stack developers.",
